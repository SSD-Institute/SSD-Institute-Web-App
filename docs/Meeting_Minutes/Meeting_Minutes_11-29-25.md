# Meeting Minutes – November 29

Prior to today’s meeting, it was noted that no formal team meetings were required over the past few weeks. Each team member was already aware of their assigned tasks and continued progress independently.  

Outlined below is the list of items that were scheduled for completion during the weeks when we did not convene.

## November 8

1. Finishing up the draft **Screen Sequence**; a pull request will be submitted for questions and feedback this weekend.  
2. Completing the draft **Project Plan**, expected to be available this weekend.  
3. **Justin Maga**: Close the file structure issue, update the RACI with assignments noted last weekend, and submit a PR. *(No meeting notes this week)*  
4. **Austin R. Pringle**: Once items 1 & 2 are merged, proceed with a draft **Technical Design Specification Document**.  
5. **Stuart D. Krueger**: Once items 1 & 2 are merged, proceed with a draft **Presentation for Dec 1st**. Prepare an outline, slides, and assigned portions (who will speak about what). Also prepare logical and conceptual ERDs in similar fashion.
