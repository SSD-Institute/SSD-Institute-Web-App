# Meeting Minutes: September 20, 2025

## Action Items & Updates

* **Clarify Project Deliverables:** Thom will follow up with the instructor to clarify the difference between the "peer evaluations report" and the "submit work document," and to confirm all due dates.
* **End-of-Day Task:** Thom will send over the necessary information for a pull request on GitHub for the project skeleton.
* **Documentation Workflow:** For now, each team member will work on their documentation and submit pull requests immediately. A formal review process will be implemented later in the project.

## User Story Development

* **User Research:** Austin and Thom will meet to discuss user stories and then reach out to staff members to gather information. The team decided to focus on **user-based stories** rather than conducting a general street survey.
* **Pull Request Method:** We will use a **forking workflow** for all pull requests.
