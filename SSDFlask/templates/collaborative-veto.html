    <h1>Collaborative Veto</h1>
    <p>
        The Collaborative Veto empowers local communities to override higher-level government decisions if a significant minority disagrees. 
        By allowing one-third of counties or municipalities to object, policy-making shifts downward to the most local level possible. 
        This cascading system ensures that governance remains adaptable and directly reflects the specific needs of smaller geographic units.
