    <h1>Multi-choice Voting</h1>
    <p>
        Multi-choice voting permits citizens to cast votes for every candidate they support rather than being limited to a single selection. 
        This approach eliminates the "spoiler effect" and reduces the need for strategic voting by allowing a broader expression of voter preference. 
        The candidate with the highest total support wins, more accurately reflecting the collective will of the electorate.
