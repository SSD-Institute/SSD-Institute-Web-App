    <h1>Minimum Amount of Space</h1>
    <p>
        Minimum Amount of Space guarantees every citizen an inalienable, untaxed plot of land based on a specific mathematical formula. 
        This land is allocated from private holdings or federal reserves and cannot be sold or seized, ensuring a fundamental right to exist. 
        The concept aims to replace traditional welfare with tangible independence and long-term stability for every individual.
