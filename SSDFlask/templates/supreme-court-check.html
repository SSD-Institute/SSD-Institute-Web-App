    <h1>Supreme Court Veto</h1>
    <p>
        The Supreme Court Veto introduces a democratic check on judicial power by allowing a simple majority of states to reject a ruling. 
        If 26 or more states object, the decision no longer applies nationwide, returning the authority to individual states to set their own policies. 
        This model balances federal judicial oversight with state autonomy and direct accountability to citizens.
